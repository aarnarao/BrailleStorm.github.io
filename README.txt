Deaf-blind persons find it difficult to easily avail a large number of media and convey ideas  on the internet due to accessibility issues.
The idea is to create a universal portal with access to learning material for deaf-blind people, which can be linked to a refreshable braille display in order to optimize education for differently abled people in a way that is cost effective and efficient.
